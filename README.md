# Planning

A list-oriented GTK ideation and daily planner. Works offline and can backs up/pull from a NAS when needed.

## Vision

Milanote and Trello are the two primary competitors for tracking and planning your goals and tasks. But there's a fundamental distraction problem with both. If you're into customization, you may focus too much on the little details and making your planner pixel perfect before even planning anything! Planning is an alternative that isn't web based and works offline so you can ideate and plan without any distractions.

Planning won't support images or mind maps (this is a job for Obsidian) - instead it's a hyperfocused text-only app.
